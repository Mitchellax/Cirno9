	What we learnt today is divided into three parts. The first part is the definition of software processes and software process models. The concepts of software process is very clear that it is the way for programmer to make a software product which is required by customers. As for software process model, it is a rough work process for software process. However, we cannot finish all programs with just one model, so there comes the part two: five different types of software process models, which are "Build and fix", "Waterfall", "Incremental", Spiral" as well as "Rapid prototype" model. we will discuss these in the question two so we do not go in details here. Finally, we learnt something about Distributed Version Control and Git. By using version control system, we can make our teamworks more efficient and convenient. We also learnt the history of version control system and we knew something about Git, which is the latest version control system. After the class, my teammates and I decided to use GitHub to work together easier and better. We not only knew many new knowledge but also aware that we can improve our group work and do much better.
