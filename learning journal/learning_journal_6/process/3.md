I used to enjoy in Version Control software and still using it for daily coding and team working. Before I took the plan with Version Control software, the main problem in my programing experience is the redundant codes in program. As completing, maintenance or developing a software, I always save the codes of current edition down in different periods of working. For what more that I have multiple computers with different functions, need to often switch to the device for developing, I have to keep every machine has a copy of each editions of the software. The Secondary problem is waste of hard disk space, and keeping all files in synchronization is only inconvenient. The fatal problem is I will forget the particular differences among those editions ever why and how I partition versions as time goes by. It will make mess on working of integration and store up hidden danger for continue designing and programing. What worse is that at the time, the main thing I did was game programming. Although it was a small project, there were still 4 people involved, and the engineering files had more complex operating systems, tedious file types and corresponding relative storage paths. The cost of repeated copies, mutual synchronization and version control is further improved.
