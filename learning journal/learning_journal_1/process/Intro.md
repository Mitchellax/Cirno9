After thinking and discussing about these four questions which Enticing deep thought, we have a more clear aim for studying in software engineering. There are our answers for these questions:

For the first question, "Why are you studying Software Engineering?", team member ***Yaochen  Wang*** given his thought hear:

>It is known to all that software have been dispensable parts of our life. For the public, they need apps for recreation, and for the experts, they need some reliable software to help them make a breakthrough. Every evidence confirms that the needs of outstanding software engineers are dramatically increase, so I do think this major is promising, and I hold the belief we will get ideal jobs unless we don’t work hard. That’s why I am studying this major.

Then let us turn to the second question, that "What is Software engineering?". ***Ziyin Wang*** gave his opinion below:

>Software Engineering is a project which uses the information technology to make a program that can let people do something easier with the help of computer, and do many other things about software such as running it and maintain its files. Besides, the process should be systematical, normative and quantitative. Anyway, Software Engineering aims to create and maintain an effective and high-quality software.

The third question, "What do you hope to learn?". ***Zhouheng Wang*** thought that:

>I hope to learn more languages to code applications, such as java , C++.Let me learn the object-oriented programming, and be proficient in using it. Let me master the basic data structure and algorithm. Every time I write a program, I want to accumulate experience and knowledge in the field of problems. I wish I can learn the ideas and logic of good software design and software engineering, and learn to use my knowledge flexibly to practical operation.

About "What is your dream for when you graduate?", our team member ***Xienan Wang*** through his idea out as:

>In general, people will choose a job associated with their subject when they graduate from college, but I’m not agree with this. In my opinion, people who work with their favorite things are lucky and happy. I love playing games, so I want to be a game designer after finishing my study in university. Fortunately, I major in software engineering, which is the basic technology for designing games. Do what I like. That’s my dream.

We got the way to study in this subject by thinking about these questions. And we will working hard to become qualified software engineers.
