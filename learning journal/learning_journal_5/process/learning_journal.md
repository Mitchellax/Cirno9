> + What did you learn today?

In today's study, I know the original meaning of software engineer. It's not what you call a career now, it's an expression of hope. At that time, computer scientists hoped that future software developers would develop software like professional engineers. Software development is slowly changing. It wasn't like today that there are lots of people learning software. And they have not been given knowledge. Programming is an intuitive process. Some people call programming art. Programming now has good teaching resources. We should go further than previous efforts of former software engineer. I will try my best to complete my programming study and achieve the best self in the future。

> + What is Software Engineering

Firstly, Software Engineering is a subject that teaches us how to realize our imagination by software, which is relevant to hardware and human activities. Software is useless if it stays alone, because it needs hardware to consist of a computer system, and this system also needs human activities to support. All of those are the basic components of the Software Engineering. Secondly, to complete a task, we need a team, not individuals. As we have done several times in these weeks, we can easily notice that teamwork is effective and necessary whenever we meet a problem. Software has some characteristics including “maintainability”, “security”, “acceptability” and so on, if we want to get a good software, all of those are of necessity, so we need a great team to face to the pressure. At last, as recorded, software engineering has a long history, and I believe that this subject will still be popular in the future, because nowadays people cannot leave their mobile phones, which means they cannot live without the necessary software in phones either.


> + Has your answer change compared with the answer you gave in week 1?

Compared to the answer we have written before, I find I have gained some new knowledges on Software Engineering.

First and foremost, software needs a hardware to support, for they are both the components of the computer system. Also, computer system requires human activities to use its functions, or it could be useless. With these factors, software can make many imaginations possible to come true. What’s more, as we have known the significance of the peer learning and working, software cannot be completed and improved by an individual, because a good software should include the following points, “maintainability”, “security”, “acceptability” and so on, which all need a wide range of ideas and creations. Last but not the least, due to the diversity and merits of the Software Engineering compared with other subjects such as Computer Science which is concerned more about the theory while SE is more practical, and System Engineering which is more complex than SE and still need SE to be its core, SE has an extremely bright future that seems undefeatable.

At the beginning of the semester, I only held a vague belief that Software Engineering was a great major that can help me to earn amounts of money after graduation. Today, I have a clear view of it, which, also means a lot to my future learning and work.

> + Reflect on these and give a brief summary

Software Engineering is aims to create good software. First of all, it must be easily to be understood how to operate it by users. Next, different customers have various requirements, so it need to be evolved with the requirement. Then, even if the system failure happens, it should not do any harm, neither to physical aspect nor the economic one. Besides, using the resources properly and working quickly are essential. And finally, it must can be accepted and run with the systems which it uses. But to be a professional software, it need to be developed by groups rather than only one people.
